# arduino_utility

This is a TS CLI prototyping utility to try out a serial communication interface to an Arduino Uno that is connected to a NeoPixel Ring LED.  The goal is to write a sort of serial API to directly control the state, color, brightness, etc. externally and use it as a status display or really
for anything!
